      <h1>Steps:</h1>
      <ol>
          <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or heavily weighted pot on medium-high heat. Mix together seasonings for the wings in a small bowl.</li>
          <li>Clean your wings and remove any excess skin. Make sure the wings are fully dry before seasoning. In a large bowl, add 3 tbsp of cooking oil and half of the seasoning mixture to the chicken wings. Mix until fully seasoned</li>
          <li>In a large bowl or plastic Ziploc bag, mix together the remaining seasoning and flour. Toss the wings in the seasoned flour.</li>
          <li>Begin frying the wings in batches when the oil reaches 350°F. Fry until golden brown and crispy (about 6 - 8 minutes). The wings should reach 165°F internally. Typically, they will be fully cooked when they begin to float. Remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate.</li>
          <li>While the wings are frying, combine the ingredients for the sauce in a small saucepot on medium heat. When the sauce begins to bubble, turn the heat down to low.</li>
          <li>When all of the wings are fully cooked, toss the wings in the heated sauce. Make sure that they are fully coated in sauce. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce and enjoy!</li>
